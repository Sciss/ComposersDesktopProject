How to build CDP programs on Linux


1. install/configure dependencies.

(a) libaaio.a.

This is a small utility library which implements keyboard input via "getch" etc.
(from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/aaio/)


unpack libaaio-0.3.1.tar.bz2
run ./configure; sudo make install

(the CDP makefiles expect libaaio to be in "the usual place", i.e. /usr/local/lib)


2. configure and build the portaudio static library (needed for the audio programs paplay, pvplay,recsf, listaudevs)

A portaudio directory is provided, with  some special changes (configure.in) needed for the Windows platform
in the release7 directory.

DO NOT just run ./configure etc; the audio program makefile expect both alsa and jack to be available.
See the file palinuxbuild.txt for details.
Note that all the portaudio test prgrams will also be built.


3. Build CDP programs

A "standard" build system has not been developed yet; we will probably use Scons or CMake for later source releases.

The build is managed by a shell script calling individual plain makefiles in each source directory.

in the "dev" directory, run the script ./makeprograms.sh

All programs will be stored in the local Release directory. 
They can be copied from here into (e.g) the default cdpr7 system directory (in ~/cdpr7_cdp/_cdprogs),
where Soundloom will look for them.

See the general CDP installation notes regarding manual setup for cdpr7, Soundloom, environment variables,etc.

Note that at present, Soundloom is not yet fully functional under Linux, further porting work
is required.

NB for Csound users: the original CDP program "sndinfo" clashes with the Csound utility of the same name.
When used with Soundloom this will not matter, as Soundloom will expect to find sndinfo inside the _cdprogs folder.
Otherwise, for command line use, we suggest simply renaming sndinfo to any preferred unique name.
