How to build CDP programs on Windows.

The MinGW development environment is required (gcc toolset).


1. configure and build the portaudio static library (needed for the audio programs paplay, pvplay,recsf, listaudevs)

A portaudio directory is provided, with  some special changes needed for the Windows platform.
DO NOT just run ./configure etc; the build is likely to fail.
See the file pamingwbuild.txt for details.

Note that all the portaudio test programs will also be built.

3. Build CDP programs

A "standard" build system has not been developed yet; we will probably use Scons for later source releases.

The build is managed by a shell script calling individual plain makefiles in each source directory.
Note there are no default "Makefile" files. There are separate Makefiles for MinGW and OSX, selected automatically by the script.

in the "dev" directory, run the script ./makeprograms.sh

All programs will be stored in the local Release directory. There are 151 in all.

They can be copied from here into (e.g) the default cdpr7 system directory (in _cdp/_cdprogs,
where Soundloom will look for them.

See the general CDP installation notes regarding setup for cdpr7, Soundloom, environment variables,etc.
