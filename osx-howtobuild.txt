How to build CDP programs on OS X


1. install/configure dependencies.

(a) libaaio.a.

This is a small utility library which implements keyboard input via "getch" etc.
(from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/aaio/)


unpack libaaio-0.3.1.tar.bz2
run ./configure; sudo make install

(the CDP makefiles expect libaaio to be in "the usual place", i.e. /usr/local/lib)


2. configure and build the portaudio static library (needed for the audio programs paplay, pvplay,recsf, listaudevs)

A portaudio directory is provided, with  some special changes (configure.in) needed for the Windows platform
in the release7 directory.

DO NOT just run ./configure etc; the build is likely to fail.
See the file pamacbuild.txt for details.
Note that all the portuaido test prgrams will also be built.


3. Build CDP programs

A "standard" build system has not been developed yet; we will probably use Scons or CMake for later source releases.

The build is managed by a shell script calling individual plain makefiles in each source directory.

in the "dev" directory, run the script ./makeprograms.sh

All programs will be stored in the local Release directory. 
They can be copied from here into (e.g) the default cdpr7 system directory (in _cdp/_cdprogs,
where Soundloom will look for them.

See the general CDP installation notes regarding setup for cdpr7, Soundloom, environment variables,etc.
